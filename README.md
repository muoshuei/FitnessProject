FitnessProject
==============
A School Project aiming for connecting react-native with mediapipe pose

### Dependencies

See package.json *dependencies* 

### Note

Version for react-native-vision-camera and react-native-reanimated seemed to be vey specific. Highly recommend to get the exact same version to have the project work. Also, if there is other dependencies or tuning of certain files needed but not mentioned above, please reach out for me to give a test and updates.
 

### Guide

## Javascript 
Go to ./Assets/Components to see all react components used. Mostly inside CameraPage.tsx.

## Java
Go to ./android/app/src/main/java/com/newfitnessproject/mycustom

Inside this directory, MyCustomPlugin.java works with most of the calculating logic.
