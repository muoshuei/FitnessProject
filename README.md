FitnessProject
==============
A School Project aiming for connecting react-native with mediapipe pose

###Frameworks used:

react@18.0.0
react-native@0.69.9
react-native-vision-camera@2.14.1
react-native-reanimated@2.10.0

@react-navigation/native-stack@6.9.12
@react-navigation/elements@1.3.17
@react-navigation/native@6.1.6

###Note

Version for react-native-vision-camera and react-native-reanimated seemed to be vey specific. Highly recommend to get the exact same version to have the project work. Also, if there is other dependencies or tuning of certain files needed but not mentioned above, please reach out for me to give a test and updates.
